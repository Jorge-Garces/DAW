a) Modify your script of activity three (cinema with the DOM).

b) Modify your script of activity five (directory tree).

Assesment:

EACH REMAKE OF THE JQUERY VERSION OF YOUR THREE APPS WILL HAVE TO:

1) Code is indented, commented and all in English.

2) The new version is fully functional (all the required features are present).

3) All possible javascript code lines are translated into Jquery.

4) Add animations (movements:specially in the folder app) and effects with Jquery where possible (in all apps).

5) All messages MUST be shown on the DOM (no ALERT or any other pop up window) using jquery.

6) New version is optimized (no repeated lines, modular functions...)

7) New version is robust (no unexpected or default behaviours, clear messages... )

8) Correct handling of events (event propagation,callback functions are correctly used in jquery...)

9) Connections to Server and Database are correctly handled for the third task in jquery .
